# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to view and analyze UFO-sightings recorded around the world. Results can easily be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape of the anomaly. The goal of the project is to help raise awareness about how commonplace UFO sightings are worldwide.

## Results
The filter can be used to hone the sightings data down to a specific date and location, along with the shape of the anomaly. The filter is useful because once you type in the search criteria, the data is automatically filtered so that you can view the results. In the example below, all of the sightings that are recorded from 1/10/2010 are displayed on the page. 
#### Filter UFO Sightings by Date

## Summary
A drawback of the new filter design is that the filter box is a fixed shape, rather than a dynamic shape. This would be useful for users when scrolling down large lists of data entries. In addition, the filter is a very dark color and blends into the background, so it would be helpful if the filter box were a different color from the background. Another useful addition would be to add a filter for the event time, so that users can sort sightings by time and get a better image of any sighting patterns within the data (i.e., if a person in the next city over sees the same anomaly a few seconds or minutes after the prior sighting).
